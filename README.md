# Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation

## Objective:
To understand what makes a password strong and test it using online tools.

## Passwords Tested:
1. `123password` — Weak
2. `emailid$@2025` — Moderate
3. `8h98FVH5ub5%uig6` — Strong

## Tool Used:
https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/

## Results:
| Password         | Score | Feedback                           |
|------------------|-------|------------------------------------|
| 123password      | 25%   | Too common, lacks symbols          |
| emailid$@2025    | 60%   | Better, but predictable pattern    |
| 8h98FVH5ub5%uig6 | 90%   | Strong - high complexity & length  |

## Best Practices Learned:
- Use at least 12 characters
- Mix upper & lower case letters
- Include symbols & numbers
- Avoid dictionary words or common patterns
- Consider using passphrases

## Common Attacks:
- **Brute Force**: Tried all combinations; longer passwords slow it down.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses known word lists; avoid common words.
